# melody-generator
The aim of the project is to develop a program that automatically creates melodic sequences based on musical rules. The user sets the parameters (key, melody length, The maximum allowable interval between notes), after which the program generates a sequence of notes, saves it in the .mid file and displays a graphical representation of the melody.
